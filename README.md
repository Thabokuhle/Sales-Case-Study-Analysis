## 🔍 Key Findings
- Demand was **highly elastic** on March 5–7 — quantity dropped sharply after price increases.  
- Promotions produced **negative results** — lower quantity and reduced GP.  
- GP per unit **decreased significantly** during discounted periods.  
- Stable prices (**R38–R39**) performed best.

---

## 📝 Recommendations
- Avoid aggressive price cuts — they reduce both quantity and profitability.  
- Use **bundle promotions** rather than lowering prices.  
- Keep pricing within the **R38–R39** optimal range.  
- Ensure stock availability before promotions.  
- Monitor elasticity and GP daily using dashboards.
