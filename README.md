📘 README — Sales Case Study (Elasticity, GP Analysis, & Promotions)
📌 Overview
This workbook analyzes sales performance for the period 1–7 March 2016, focusing on:
Daily pricing
Quantity sold
Gross profit (GP)
Gross profit per unit
Price elasticity of demand
Promotional impact
The purpose is to understand how price changes influence quantity sold and profitability, and to guide smarter pricing and promotion strategies.
📂 File Structure
The spreadsheet contains the following sheets:
1. Pivot Table — Price & Quantity

Date
Average price per unit
Quantity sold
Price change %
Quantity change %
Elasticity
Used to understand the sensitivity of demand to price changes.
2. Gross_Profit_Per_Unit
Calculates:
Revenue
Cost
GP per unit
Shows how profitable each sale was on a per-unit basis.
3. Daily_Gross_Profit
Summarizes:
Total daily revenue
Total daily cost
Daily gross profit
Used to track profitability trends across days.
4. Elasticity_Chart

Price change %
Quantity change %
Elasticity
Used to identify how customers react to price adjustments.
5. Price_Trends_By_Month
Shows:
Monthly average price

Useful for spotting seasonal or long-term patterns.
📈 Key Metrics
1. Price Change %
Measures the daily percentage change in price.
2. Quantity Change %
Measures the daily change in units sold.
3. Elasticity Formula
Elasticity = Quantity_change% / Price_change%
Shows how sensitive demand is to price changes.
🔍 Key Findings
Demand became highly elastic on March 5–7, showing large quantity drops in response to price changes.
Promotions during the week produced negative results — lower quantity and reduced GP.
GP per unit decreased significantly during discounted periods.
Stable prices (R38–R39) performed best.
📝 Recommendations
Avoid aggressive price cuts; they reduce profit and quantity.
Use bundle promotions rather than price drops.
Keep prices within the R38–R39 optimal band.
Ensure stock availability before promotions to avoid lost sales.
Monitor elasticity and GP daily using dashboards.
